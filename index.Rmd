## Goal of the Analysis

This analysis investigates how liquidity is affected by periods of high trade intensity.  We test whether the following measures, in the few seconds before a trade, have an effect on the book's liquidity in the 100 milliseconds after the trade.

-  number of changes in the orderbook.

-  size of the bid-ask spread.

-  number of trades.

## Results

We find evidence consistent with larger bid-ask spreads leading to greater amounts of liquidity being provided by HFT post-trade and HFT providing liquidity when there is more activity in the orderbook.
